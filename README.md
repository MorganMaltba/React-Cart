# React Cart!
### A shopping cart made with React and Strapi!

**Description:** <br>
This project runs React to render functional components that mimic a shopping cart!<br>
- Add and remove items from the cart!<br>
- Checkout tracks total!<br>
- Product list tracks stock!<br>
- Fetch new products from Strapi database!<br>

**How to Run:** <br>
This one is a bit trickier, and the DB folder is MUCH too large for GitHub. <br>
1. Download all files into a designated directory
2. Create Strapi database (see strapi-setup for details)
3. Initialize a local HTTP-server in the designated directory
4. See in your hosted server!

**Roadmap of future improvements:** <br>
- *Actual* Product Photos
